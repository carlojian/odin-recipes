            <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Potatoes:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wash and peel the potatoes (or leave the skin on for a rustic touch).</li>
                    <li>Cut the potatoes into uniform, matchstick-sized pieces (about 1/4-inch thick).</li>
                </ul>

            <li><strong>Rinse and Soak:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Place the cut potatoes in a bowl of cold water. Let them soak for at least 30 minutes
                        (or up to 2 hours) to remove excess starch.</li>
                </ul>

            <li><strong>Heat the Oil:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a deep fryer or large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat vegetable oil to 350-375°F (175-190°C).
                         Use enough oil to fully submerge the potatoes.</li>
                </ul>

            <li><strong>Dry the potatoes:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Drain the soaked potatoes and pat them dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture.</li>
                </ul>

            <li><strong>Fry the Potatoes:</strong></li>
                <ul>Carefully add a batch of the dried potato sticks to the hot oil. Fry until they are golden brown
                     and crispy, about 3-4 minutes per batch.</ul>
                <ul>Use a slotted spoon to remove the fries from the oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain. 
                    Sprinkle with salt immediately while they're hot.</ul>
                <ul>Repeat the frying process with the remaining potatoes.</ul>

            <li><strong><em>Serve:</em></strong></li>
                <ul>Serve your homemade French fries hot and crispy. Pair them with ketchup or your favorite dipping sauce for
                     an extra burst of flavor.</ul>
        </ol>

            <p><strong>Indulge in the satisfaction of these homemade French fries, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. 
                They're the perfect accompaniment to any meal or a delightful snack all on their own!</strong>
