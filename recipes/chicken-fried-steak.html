        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prep the steaks:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Place the cube steaks between two sheets of plastic wrap or wax paper.</li>
                    <li>Use a meat mallet to pound the steaks to about 1/4-inch thickness.</li>
                    <li>Season each steak with salt and pepper on both sides.</li>
                </ul>
            
            <li><strong>Set Up the Dredging Station:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a shallow bowl, combine the flour, salt, pepper, paprika, and cayenne pepper.
                         Mix well.</li>
                    <li>In another shallow bowl, whisk together the eggs and buttermilk.</li>
                </ul>

            <li><strong>Coat the steaks:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dip each steak into the flour mixture, 
                        ensuring it's evenly coated, and shake off any excess.</li>
                    <li>Next, dip it into the egg and buttermilk mixture,
                         allowing any excess to drip off.</li>
                    <li>Return the steak to the flour mixture and coat it one more time, 
                        pressing the flour mixture onto the steak to adhere.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            
            <li><strong>Fry the Steaks:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a large skillet, heat about 1/4 inch of vegetable oil over medium-high
                         heat until it shimmers.</li>
                    <li>Carefully place the coated steaks into the hot oil. Fry for about 3-4 minutes per 
                        side or until they are golden brown and crispy.</li>
                    <li>Remove the steaks from the skillet and place them on a paper towel-lined plate 
                        to drain any excess oil.</li>
                </ul>

            <li><strong>Make the Gravy:</strong></li>
                <Ul>
                    <li>In the same skillet, melt the butter over medium heat.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle in the flour and whisk continuously for 1-2 minutes to create a roux.</li>
                    <li>Gradually pour in the milk while whisking constantly to prevent lumps.</li>
                    <li>Continue to cook and whisk until the gravy thickens, about 3-5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Season the gravy with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
